# Tic-Tac-Toe
With this project in Python, I have successfully made the Tic Tac Toe game. I used the popular pygame library for rendering graphics on a display window. I learned how to capture events from the keyboard or mouse and trigger a function when the mouse button is pressed. This way we can calculate mouse position, draw X or O on the display and check if the player wins the game or not.
